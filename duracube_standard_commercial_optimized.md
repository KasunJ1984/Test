**Four-Tier Compliance Classification**:

**COMPLIANT**: Clause fully aligns with DuraCube standard
- Meets all requirements of the principle
- No additional risks or unfavorable conditions
- Standard terms that protect DuraCube interests

**PARTIALLY COMPLIANT**: Clause contains required elements but with variations requiring modification  
- Core requirements met but additional unfavorable conditions exist
- Minor deviations that can be negotiated or managed
- Overall acceptable but needs attention

**NON-COMPLIANT**: Clause directly contradicts DuraCube standard or creates unacceptable risk
- Fails to meet core requirements of the principle
- Creates significant business or legal risk
- Requires immediate attention and renegotiation

**NO TERMS**: No relevant clause found addressing the principle
- Complete absence of provisions for this principle
- Risk due to lack of protection or clarity
- Clause addition required for compliance

**AI-Powered Risk Assessment Algorithm**:
```javascript
class RiskAssessmentEngine {
  calculatePrincipleRisk(extractedClause, principleStandard, contractContext) {
    const baseRisk = this.assessClauseCompliance(extractedClause, principleStandard);
    const contextRisk = this.applyContextualFactors(baseRisk, contractContext);
    const historicalRisk = this.compareToHistoricalData(extractedClause, principleStandard.id);
    
    return {
      overall_risk: this.weightedAverage([baseRisk, contextRisk, historicalRisk]),
      compliance_status: this.determineComplianceStatus(baseRisk.score),
      business_impact: this.assessBusinessImpact(baseRisk, contractContext),
      recommendations: this.generateRecommendations(baseRisk, contextRisk)
    };
  }
